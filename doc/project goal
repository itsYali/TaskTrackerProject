Project Title: Task Tracker

  High-Level Functionalities:
  •	Users can add tasks, set target dates, and mark tasks as completed.
  •	Tasks can be filtered by status (complete/incomplete, target date met/missed).
  •	User registration and login system for personal list of tasks.
  
Example Scenarios:
  Scenario: A user wants to track a new task
  •	Message request:
  The user wants to add a new task to the list, including a name and a target date.
  •	How it’s processed:
    o	The user enters the task name and selects a target date in a “Add Task” form.
    o	PHP receives the form data, checks that all required fields are filled, and 
      validates the input.
    o	If valid, PHP saves the new task to the database.
  •	How the system responds:
    o	If the task is added successfully, the system shows a confirmation message 
      and updates the task list to include the new task.
    o	If there is an error (such as missing information), the system displays an 
      error message and asks the user to correct it.
    
  Scenario: A user wants to filter their tasks by status
  •	Message request:
  The user wants to view certain tasks by filtering the list (for example by 
  completed, incomplete, target date met, or target date missed).
  •	How it’s processed:
    o	The user selects a filter option (by clicking a button or choosing from a 
      dropdown menu).
    o	PHP receives the selected filter and queries the database for tasks that 
      match the chosen status.
  •	How the system responds:
    o	The system displays an updated list of tasks that meet the filter criteria.
    o	If no tasks match the filter, the system shows a message like “No tasks 
      found.”
